first stream.

## before going live:
- setting up all passwords/secrets/keys. email, git, twitch
- do a first test to make sure it all works.
- eat

### ssh
https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

why not just follow the guide

### twitch
- install obs
- copy the stream key
- change encoding to make it work

### others
- update drivers
- isntall vim, tmux, htop























# 001
## weekend projet
cloning(ish) swarm simulator - https://www.swarmsim.com/#/

## done before
- installed pop_os
- updated drivers
- installed/setup: git/github, twitch, gmail, vim, vscode

## getting started
we're going to keep it as simple as possible for now. we want to have it hosted and runnig on github. 
bootstrapping the project
- using liveserver to run the dev env

## V0.1
we got our stuff started. forgot i didn't create the repo on github yet...
reloading works. i didn't do anything too embarasing stuff works on teh first go aroung.

now it's time to stop a little and think about what we want to build.
- we can forget about the qol stuff for now. like the intro message and the tutorial/guide messages.
- we want the base game loop - a ressource ticking, and some upgrades. swarm has two ress. the ones based on meat, and teh larvae. for now. it ticks and we spend ressources to advance in the different trees - adding more trees. trees, but mostly parallel tracks if they never branch, or create more than one ressource.
- lets get go for a single tree. single resource, just ticking. that will create the base engine - if we want to call it that.




## so another crash
not going to retype all this, well all that.

lets just get on with it

everything is pretty slow, there are a few thing that are wrong with the network, all the devices are pretty slow.

some other thing could be improved with light weight alternatives - eg window manager, terminal, removing unessential services...

still waiting....

we can move on to coding instead of waiting our time

stuff is hard without autocomplete and codhints.....

## the end
this was a good star - cehcking things out...
too bad about the crash. but forced my hand to go use vim.
might even try my hand at emacs. the lisp  aspect seems fun.
we can also figure out a few more things in the tooling aspect. a more lightweight wm might be handy. 

no one really tuned in but that's fine. it's even better than fine, we can actully do things more freely without all that pressute :D 

but we can continue on tomorrow easily. the first friday after a vacation is always a little rough...

done :D
