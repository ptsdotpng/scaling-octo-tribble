second stream. mannaged to get midori installed through apt, instead of the package manager.
so now that appcenter thing is taking the most memory. we can try to replace that later on.
but right now we need to setup vim a little more, we're not going to go far without autocomplte :(

so lets dive into the fun world of configuring vim

## vim config
- adjust minor things - tab width, fonts, etc
- config airline - get the fonts etc...
- get js autocomplete

as always, googling it shoudl give us a good starting point

too much stuff, lets just get the basics

## okayish
yeah, for now
we can start getting a little better with vim
we'll need to figure out the tabs/buffer situation

## coding
so we made a little mistake last night, we're inseritng the current
value in the generating slot.
apart from that we have our firt ressource. the strucutre of the ress
tile can be replicated, we'll split it from the tech tree and add some
simple update tile thing

## break for lunch and stuff
going to break
environment is starting to be somewhat useable
need to at some point figure out those saved tmux sessions so we can
reload everythin back up easily
and webkit is still a bit of a hog so some even lighter env might be
needed

# back from lunch
took the opportunity for a quick reboot
need to bring stuff back up

and now we can keep our notes here :D

and now time for coffee

and we can review the swar while we're at it.

- so we start with a little meat - R1
- and a steady flow of larvea - R2. 
- we spend R1/2 to purchase a R1 producer - P1
- once we get to 10? in P1, we unlock P2
- P2 is build by spending P1, R1, R2.
- P2 produces P1 - so R1.
- each producer P has 2 upgrades. produce more of their R, or get more
  items per purchase
- the more per purchase is bought using Rn+1 ress. 
- at some point we unlock another ressorce with basically the same
  functionning - we just mix and match the ressource usage.


fun stuff - but still probably just poke around linux a little more,
get lighter replacement, and tweak teh stream settings - the fan is
spinnig loudly, and without sound or video...

## i3
got i3 to launch
pretty quick - low foot print
lets start an env todo list
