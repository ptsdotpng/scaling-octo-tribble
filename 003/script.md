got a few things changed since last time. 
got i3 to run and it feel a lot snappier than the last wm.
there's a problem with obs. not sure if it'll be visible on stream,
but the ui is broken.
let's check
so yeah, it doesn't work quite right
the shortcuts are nice. we'll need to keep the cheat sheet open/at
hand

the default lancher didn't work. the command would show it, but it
would segfault when typing.
i changed it to this one rofi. had to look the name up again... but it
works.

also got this. since i don't have a mike on this comp.

got distarcted, but improvised a little bash script to say things.
there should be a way to automate a global shortcut
it might be working already with rofi
