  nicer

# internet
everything is way too laggy.
lets see if we can find anything out?
so we removed pihole to see if that has an impact. maybe
but still there seems like there are fewer issues when tracing.
we'll see, try for more info tomorrow...

# where we left off
trying to fix the internet to isntall more tools

still slow....

wanted to get nerdtree cheatsheet
gonna try it anyways - or just get it on my other computer :D
lets still check the built in help

all seems complicated for just a simple file craetion....
