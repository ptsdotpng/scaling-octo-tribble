# 005
so we're going to try to isntall the tools again

# scratch that
taking way too much time. 
we'll investigate the internet a little bit on a machine where it
still works. this is a little too frustrating

# back to the swarm
and lets not gte taken too offtrack. lets just try to copy it as is
and as easily as possible. maybe not the whole style. that'll take too
much time

to stay on the right side of copiright, we'll use parody to shield us
from any legal ramifications :) 

# done for the night
gonna go and make some food. 
we did do some stuff, getting used to the mostly keyboard workflow
through i3
it seems like a better value offer to do as much as we can with i3
than another tool/plugin. 
that way stuff works out of just git - eg. for nerdtree stuf...
it's nice to just copy instead of creating. makes it a little more
zen, craftsmapship thing. no questions, just make.

we'll keep going later. maybe tomorrow.
a 6 to 7.30/8 might be the stable schedule for now
