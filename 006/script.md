hump day. 

last stream retro. did some progress on the swarm project
internet still seems unstable, although better today

we gotta get back to our previous setup

# env setup
- one main window - this
- one sidebar to keep a cheat sheet - gotta remember a lot of things
  now - i3, vim, vim plugins, etc...
- in the main window
  - a terminal for random stream stuff - this
  - a terminal with tmux for runnig a couple of projet things - git
    adn server
  - a terminal to run vim
  - a firefox window to run our project
- in another desktop - firefox - for references - game, other lookups

it's not too hard to setup manually every time, but lets see how i3
saves stuff

finding a way to also controls firefox with keyboard shortcuts should
be nice, since it's the only thing i need to use the mouse for.

lets forget the layout - it does't seem to open apps, just the
windows, i can open it by hand for now

# back to the swarm
so right now we have a pretty simple structure.
our dev will pretty much follow the game progression.
we're going to need to spawn more larvae

# larvae 
- ok we got larvae
- now we need meat.
- now drones - but first water

# other stream stuff
so the code is going along alittle. lets just do some stream stuff to
finish it up.

# :(
well the internet is a bit shitty.... still
but the streak is there. you might not see it, but i did. and as the
kinks get irond out, things will become more pleasant.

we can start getting a little more stream stuff....


## continuing on
i did end up adding a scheduel to the channel. so i should at least
stick to it the first go around
- this is not going to be pretty, a lot of hardcoding, and trying to
  ignore future issues. but it'll be a nice change from all the usual
overengeneering
- i guees reading can be useful. it might be easier to just go with
  the inline method - we won't have to manage a bunch of elements, and
handlers and stuff... 
- buying issues - right now our tick is 1s. it's ok - it matches with
  the generating rates, but it does slow down our updates. it gives a
little bit of an update lag when buying stuff. but we can just start
having a todo list. since it's going to be a big change we're not
going to be able to finish now...
- again - full of future issues - but it works. the rates increase.
  now we need to actually spend the money/ressources
- ok, so that works. ish. we need to check if we have the cahs first.
  but later me problems.
- right now, lets just keep some sated state thing. just to get some
  continuity
- something's wrong.... hunger- had already done a little more
  streaming before the actual schedueled stream, so we'll stop here
for now
