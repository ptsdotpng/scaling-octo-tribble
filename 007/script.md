# 007
a full week.
and james bond.

i want to check a couple of things on/about twitch. 
- i think i read that you could interact with the chat through irc?
- i should check best practices/video settings for this type of
  content - mostly text, not as much detail as video games, and
general graphic content
- there should be some comprehensive guide on setting up a channel,
  things we can set/add to make things go better? probably following
through on projects and not jumping on a bunch of different topics
would help...
- i thinkt the inernet is still funky, so research might be a little
  frustrating, but the irc one should be fine.
- as always, we'll create a repo for that too. we want those sweet
  sweet github squares
- lets just try this later for shortcuts -> a cmd. just a script opens
  it in vim.

i dont know why i kept using bullet points...
so figures - internet not great.

i'll be doing the cheatsheet one first, or during loads

really need vim lessons - well git too...
who doesn't
