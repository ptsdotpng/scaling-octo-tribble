so i'm back. took a little break over the week end to get a better idea?/focus? for the stream. clarify a little what this is all about. 

it was a little much to get into it while trying to get used to a new setup with i3/vim only, to get an old computer up and runnig though shitty wifi, get a stream started, and actualy produce code for side projects.

so fo this one i'm back to a more familiar workflow, with familiar tools. and better hardware with better wifi. and what i'll be doing is focusing on the stream. push projects to later. so most problems are taken care of. for now.

what we have here is a default-ish osx user. i just created a fresh one, and resetup the accounts - github/twitch/email - and adjusted the obs settings a little to be able to capture the stream. so apart from these things, all changes/preferences/settings to the account will be tracked/captured.

now i don't really need to do much more. vs code is installed, git, iterm, etc... so i can go back to developing. 

i know, i said focus on the stream. so that's what i'm going to do. and first thing i'm going to do is write a little description of the stream. what it's supposed to be and what i'm going to be doing on it. there's probably a space for that on twitch, but lets start with a more free from about site, get an idea of what i want to say, and how to say it, and then see where we can fill stuff out on twitch. 

to get started we'll go again with a repo, i want those green squares :D
