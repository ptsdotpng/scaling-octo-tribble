getting some things. the scheduel is a bit too ambitious. everyday is a lot of days...

before getting into too much coding again, i want to adjust a few thigngs:
- osx settings - ajust that dock and other options
- twitch profile - it does ask for a bunch of stuff - stream titles, desctiptions, etc...
- github profile
- github hosting for whatever we have now.
- and twitch chat irc... maybe - if there's time

# colors and shit
- lets keep these here for now...
    :root {
        --bg: #002b36;
        --c2: #cb4b16;
        --fg: #839496;
        --c1: #b58900;
        --c3: #d33682;
        --c4: #859900;
        --c5: #073642;
        --c6: #2aa198;
        --c7: #268bd2;
        }
- fot sizes - going to get a pic generator at some point

- ok got some stuff on twich. lets add more on github, link the two in a cirlce, and then we can get back to coding... well, hosting, then irc, then coding....
- first coffee/bio break
- off to gihub :)
- so miniaml githib profile, stuff pushed, need to host the html now... 
- well for some reason it needs the index.html in the url... good enought for now.
- lets get to that irc chat, i think taht was all that was left...
- thought it would be easy peasy, but a littl emore involved, and don't want to mess around with passwords and auth on stream
- back to the code then
- not going to get irc, but i can pop out the chat... at least.

- taking another little bio break, after that we'll get into the parser.... i want to write out a little more content before getting into more features. features are nice, and they're fun to play around with, but lets try to implement stuff we need to deliver the content we want first

- bio break

## end
so some progress, regex is alluring, but hard. easire to jsut to teh work normally...
