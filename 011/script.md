so i didn't create a script thing from th eget go -_-
but that's ok, we're foing it now...
so i got a limited pareser working. it wonks out at 2 sub levels, but at least it works, not like regex. i'd still like to get it working with them, but now's not the time. 
we'll stick with few levels, polish the text. 
get to the point where having it in mardkwonish is useful -> we can present it as a normal page. so if you don't want to type stuff and just get the content, that's possible. and it also gives a place to have a little intro first. explaining the concept of etc...
and that's the text branch.
not sure if branches are really neceesray, or even usefull at this point, but i guess it's a good habit to have, and not just stuff everything in main
