so not a lot of streaming last week.
got busy with other stuff. but i did manage to update the linux computer, found this font - https://github.com/NerdyPepper/scientifica - that kinda fits the aesthetics? (yeah, got it first time ._.) that i want to go for, and just general thinking about stuff.

## the font
keep checking the stream to see if it's legible...
but it's one of the fonts linked to in the various linux desktop customizing showcases? pics? - stuff on r/unixporn.

played around with it while setting up i3 and polybar on the desktop. didn't get to streaming on it yet. i'll probably nuke it a couple of more times before having someting stable. 

but the font and the unixporn ccolors is more the vibe i want to got for. so like terminal and retro. but this modern add on it. there's alreay more of a mix of hifi/lofi stuff - pics, music, etc... - with terminal/keyborab shortcut/cli stuff

so i'll update the color shcemes, adn a few other things on teh web site side.

all in all the vision is becoming a little clearer. unixporn is a good ressource, it has screens, colors, etc.. but already a community and a language for things - icons, fonts, type of colors etc... that will be usefull. it's all a lot more than just "retro ish".

## linux/pc
i got to reintalling again. went with base debian+nonfree for the drivers. it's a little weird. it works very well. a lot faster than pop was, the ui is less fancy. but some things seem very barebone for no reason. like some common ways to do things from teh cli are not there by default? like adding apt repos, or shutdown commands going through systemctl wihtout a nicer wrapper.

but very happy with the preformance. the main point of it. got i3gaps and polybar working. still some hiccups with poylbar. it looks nice, but some commnads don't work. 

been eyeing nix for the packages, cause i'm needing to install a bunch of small apps for the wm/general desktop environment to work.

if that works well, it might be useful to move to nixos entirely

## general direction
so the general direction is taking shape. the mood board for it would be: aesthetics, future-retro, hollywood-os, streaming, documentary, recursive, cli, video game interface, video game dialogue, codec, turtles all the way down, bts, nth wall

some of those might be a bit vague, but, hey, it's all in feels for moodboards.

day to day, here's what we're going to be doing: we are building a website to explain/advertise/companion to our streaming. and what we're streaming is the live coding of the website. one doesn't exist without the other. and as the project evolves, we end up having to build more projects, do more things, and end up streaming that too. as we stream we need to maintain it. as we maintain, we stream -_-. 

i guess i just stumbled over a massive loophole. if streamig and videos and stuff in general take a lot of work behind the scenes, just stream that too. 

# small break
got summond by the video games gods. but now we're back :)

# pic update
alright - this is done ish - but i want ot update the pics - as is tradition - project time

so it's going....going to need to finish up those other pic types...

but at least now we got a new profile picand suqares on github :)
