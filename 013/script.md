back to the grindstone
i'll keep updating the pictures, then at some point, the template could be turned to a couple of fields/sliders whatever to generate stuff... but still better to end up playing around with the html/css than try to build a from/app that could cover all possibilities.

for the main/about site, the style should be driven by the desktop style. just customize the linux desktop and try to recreate it as much a possible on the site. 

# pics and stuff
not sure where to add the other images....
anyways, messy, but it works :)

look at all those squares :)

## refactoring and cleaning
i'm going to be doing some refactoring. 
now, a lot of stuff is in the pipeline and might get lost.

i need to start splitting out some things... get the todos, readme, logs, etc..split out, clean up teh file structure, static, etc...

so first step is to get a real todo

so reafctor is starting. all the code we alrady have is going to be a little reogracnized. it's not super usable as of yet, but isn't lost....

i think in need more sound/music on the stream.... probalby will help to get more veiwers adn not not just speak to myself....
