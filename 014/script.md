i need a little task tracking system.
and changing one thing, vid in the background instead. what i do a little too often :(. probalby a little distracting

## what?
going to update little by little, starting with pseudo console stuff like the other site. and go from there

things went surprisingly smoothly. ht ekeyboard controls are ok, going to be fun to try to setup a state machine. anyways. good stuff .will be reusable later for the j3 contorls.
