not super feeling it right now. 
but we gotta get our sweet sweet github square :)

so i gotta get a little more about text... we can't just have radom stuff, with any real explanation if we start to have actual viewers :)

yes viewrs, with an s. we got two followers :). i can't vouch for the viewer count. it always seems  a little weird/off.

so we're going to be adding some text before implement the rest of the site. and godd thing is, i already have a little projet to do it... 

i have a little side project that im doing for some personal stuff. not too much now, but a nice, fun little format. before going too far, i'm going to just import it and start using it a little. add some text. just some light things, not too much code. but hey, it's streaming about streaming. and we needmore explanation about that. and that's part of the streaming experience, so it has to be streamed.

for now the projet has been kinda inported. have a copy now. and it will  become its own project/repo. but for now, i just want to replace the githubpage with it.

well we should be getting what we came here for. our square.... but for some reason it's not updating... something mgith be up with github. lets commit this one, and see
